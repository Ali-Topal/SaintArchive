          <p>
            Prizes ship from the United Kingdom. UK shipping is included. International delivery is
            available on most drops unless a listing states otherwise. If we cannot ship to your
            country, we will contact you to discuss alternatives.

        <section className="space-y-2">
          <h2 className="text-base font-semibold text-white">Delivery Timelines</h2>
          <p>
            After winner verification we prepare the prize within 2–3 working days. UK orders usually
            arrive within 2–7 working days. International shipments depend on customs clearance and
            local couriers, so please allow extra time.

        <section className="space-y-2">
          <h2 className="text-base font-semibold text-white">Tracking</h2>
          <p>
            Every parcel includes tracked shipping. We email the tracking link as soon as the courier
            scans the package. Contact us if you do not receive tracking within 48 hours of the draw.

          <h2 className="text-base font-semibold text-white">Packaging</h2>
          <p>
            Items are inspected, photographed, and packed using protective materials. High-value
            products may be double-boxed or shipped with tamper seals to guarantee authenticity on
            arrival.

          <h2 className="text-base font-semibold text-white">Damaged or Lost Parcels</h2>
          <p>
            If a parcel arrives damaged or appears lost, email us immediately with photos or the
            last tracking update. We will liaise with the courier and keep you informed. Where
            possible we will repair, replace, or offer a suitable alternative.

          <h2 className="text-base font-semibold text-white">Winner Verification</h2>
          <p>
            Before dispatch we may request ID or proof of address. Verification protects legitimate
            entrants and prevents fraudulent claims. Shipments will only be released once verification
            is complete.

          <h2 className="text-base font-semibold text-white">Customs &amp; Duties</h2>
          <p>
            For deliveries outside the UK, winners are responsible for customs duties, VAT, and
            import fees. Refusing to pay these charges may result in the parcel being returned or
            destroyed, and we cannot compensate for losses caused by refusal.
